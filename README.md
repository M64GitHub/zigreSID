# Zig SID Soundchip Emulation üéµ‚ú®

This project provides **SID soundchip emulation** for **Zig**, enabling you to generate and play SID audio with ease. It is built upon the powerful **reSID** C++ library, delivering authentic SID sound emulation combined with the simplicity and safety of Zig.

### üéß **Audio Library Independence**
This project is **audio-library agnostic** by design. The **core SID emulation and playback logic** is completely independent of any audio backend. However, the **current implementation** demonstrates audio playback using **SDL2** for convenience and cross-platform support. You can easily adapt or extend the audio interface to suit other libraries or custom solutions.

## üöÄ Features

- üéπ **SID Soundchip Emulation for Zig**: Experience the legendary SID sound directly in your Zig projects.
- ‚ö° **Powered by reSID**: Leverages the proven **reSID** C++ library for high-quality sound emulation.  
(https://github.com/daglem/reSID)
- üîß **Simplified C++ Framework**: All complex timing calculations and internal audio buffer management are handled automatically, allowing you to focus solely on the high-level API.
- üîó **C Bindings for Zig**: Provides clean **C bindings** to the simplified C++ framework, making **SID sound playback** in Zig straightforward and seamless.
- üéß **Audio Backend Flexibility**: The framework allows easy integration with different audio libraries; SDL2 is used in the current example.

## üéº **Audio and SID Chip Details**

- üéµ **Stereo Audio Output**: The generated audio fills a **stereo buffer**, providing the **SID mono signal** at **equal levels** on both **left and right** channels.
- üéöÔ∏è **Default Sampling Rate**: Set to **44.1kHz** by default. The sampling rate is **changeable at runtime** via the provided API, allowing flexible playback configurations.
- üéõÔ∏è **SID Chip Model Selection**:
  - **SID6581**: Classic SID sound with characteristic filter behavior.
  - **SID8580**: Enhanced model with improved signal-to-noise ratio (**default**).
- üåü **Highest Emulation Quality**: The emulation quality is **fixed** at the **highest level** supported by the reSID library: 
  
  > **SAMPLE_RESAMPLE_INTERPOLATE** ‚Äì providing superior sound fidelity with resampling and interpolation techniques.

## üí° How It Works

This project bridges the gap between C++, C, and Zig:

1. **ReSID C++ Library**: Handles low-level SID emulation.
2. **Simplified C++ Framework**: A custom wrapper that manages timing, buffer generation, and playback logic, so you don‚Äôt have to.
3. **C Bindings**: Exposes key C++ functionalities through a clean C interface.
4. **Zig Wrapper**: Object-oriented style Zig code that wraps the C bindings, providing an intuitive API for playback and control.
5. **SDL2 Audio Interface**: The current implementation uses SDL2 for audio playback, but this can be replaced or extended.

## üéº Example Usage

```zig
const std = @import("std");
const ReSID = @import("ReSID.zig").ReSID;
const ReSIDDmpPlayer = @import("ReSIDDmpPlayer.zig").ReSIDDmpPlayer;

pub fn main() !void {
    const stdout = std.io.getStdOut().writer();

    var sid = try ReSID.init("MyZIGSID");
    defer sid.deinit();

    sid.setDBGOutput(true);
    _ = sid.setChipModel("MOS6581");

    try stdout.print("SID instance name: {s}\\n", .{sid.getName()});

    var player = try ReSIDDmpPlayer.init(sid.ptr);
    defer player.deinit();

    player.play();
    while (true) {
        player.update();
        // Add playback logic or break conditions if needed
    }
}
```

## üõ†Ô∏è Building the Project

Ensure you have **Zig 0.13.0+** and **SDL2** development libraries installed:

```bash
sudo apt install libsdl2-dev
zig build
```

To run:

```bash
zig build run
```

Or execute the binary directly:

```bash
LD_LIBRARY_PATH=. ./zig-out/bin/zig_sid_demo
```
