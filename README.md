# Zig SID Soundchip Emulation

This project provides **SID soundchip emulation** for **Zig**, enabling you to generate and play SID audio with ease.  
It is built upon the powerful **reSID** C++ library, delivering authentic SID sound emulation combined with the simplicity and safety of Zig.  
üé∂ Because we love the Commodore 64 üé∂

### üéß **Audio Library Independence**
This project is **audio-library agnostic** by design. The **core SID emulation and playback logic** is completely independent of any audio backend. However, the **current implementation** demonstrates audio playback using **SDL2** for convenience and cross-platform support. You can easily adapt or extend the audio interface to suit other libraries or custom solutions. The playback engine supports both **automatic audio callbacks** for seamless integration and **manual audio buffer generation** for full control and customization of the audio stream.  

## üöÄ Features

- üéπ **SID Soundchip Emulation for Zig**: Experience the legendary SID sound directly in your Zig projects.
- ‚ö° **Powered by reSID**: Leverages the proven **reSID** C++ library for high-quality sound emulation.  
(https://github.com/daglem/reSID)
- üîß **Simplified Framework**: All complex timing calculations and internal audio buffer management are handled automatically, allowing you to focus solely on the high-level API.
- üîó **reSID C Bindings for Zig**: Provides clean **C bindings** and integrates a clear and explicit Zig interface making **SID sound playback in Zig** straightforward and seamless.
- üéß **Audio Backend Flexibility**: The framework allows easy integration with different audio libraries
- ‚ö° **Non-Blocking Audio Playback**: The audio playback runs in the background, so your application remains responsive and interactive while playing music.
- üßµ **Playback Support for a dedicated thread**: Provides two execution models‚Äî"unthreaded" for simple integration and multi threaded for performance improvements, **audio visualization** and -**modification** possibilities.

## üéº **Audio and SID Chip Details**

- üéµ **Stereo Audio Output**: The generated audio fills a **mono buffer**, providing the SID mono signal at equal levels on the left and right audio channel. A dual SID for a 6 voice true stereo sound is in progress.
- üéöÔ∏è **Sampling Rate**: Set to **44.1kHz** by default. The sampling rate is **changeable at runtime** via the provided API.
- üéõÔ∏è **SID Chip Model Selection**:
  - **SID6581**: Classic SID sound with characteristic filter behavior, more bassy sound.
  - **SID8580**: Enhanced model with improved signal-to-noise ratio (**default**).
- **Emulation Quality**: The emulation quality is set to the highest possible level supported by the reSID library: `SAMPLE_RESAMPLE_INTERPOLATE`.

## üí° How The reSID Integration Works

This project bridges the gap between C++, C, and Zig:

1. **reSID C++ Library**: Handles low-level SID emulation.
2. **Simplified C++ Framework**: A custom wrapper that manages timing, buffer generation, and playback logic, so you don‚Äôt have to.
3. **C Bindings**: Exposes key C++ functionalities through a clean C interface.
4. **Zig Wrapper**: A clear and explicit Zig interface built with structs and associated methods, wrapping C bindings for seamless SID playback and control.
5. **SDL2 Audio Interface**: The current demo code uses SDL2 for audio playback, but this can be replaced or extended.
6. üßµ **Threaded and Unthreaded Execution**: Use the threaded variant to move audio buffer generation out of SDL into its own thread.

## üéº Example Usage

Two examples are available for demonstration:

- üèÉ **Unthreaded Playback:** `src/main_unthreaded.zig`
- ‚ö° **Threaded Playback:** `src/main_threaded.zig`

### üèÉ **Run Unthreaded Playback**
```bash
zig build run-unthreaded
```

### ‚ö° **Run Threaded Playback**
```bash
zig build run-threaded
```

## üõ†Ô∏è Building the Project

Ensure you have **Zig 0.13.0+** and **SDL2** development libraries installed:

```bash
sudo apt install libsdl2-dev
zig build
```

Both executables will be available in `zig-out/bin/`:

- `zig_sid_demo_unthreaded`
- `zig_sid_demo_threaded`

## üß¨ **Demo Code**

### main_unthreaded.zig - audio buffer calculation in the SDL callback

This example demonstrates the simplest way to play a SID dump using the `ReSIDDmpPlayer`.  
The player processes SID register values for each virtual frame, synchronized to a virtual PAL video standard vertical sync for accurate timing.  

You can generate your own SID dumps using a siddump utility. In this demo, the SID dump is included via a C header file generated using the `xxd -i` tool.
- After initializing the `sid` and `player` struct instances, set the dump for the player:  
  ```zig
  player.setDmp(sounddata.demo_sid, sounddata.demo_sid_len);
  ```
- And to start playback, simply call:  
  ```zig
  player.play();
  ```  
- SDL2 handles audio playback in the background using its audio callback mechanism. The audiodata is also updated in the callback routine.
- Audio generation runs entirely within the SDL audio thread.

```zig
const std = @import("std");
const sounddata = @cImport({
    @cInclude("demo_sound.h");
});
const SDL = @cImport({
    @cInclude("SDL.h");
});

const ReSID = @import("resid.zig").ReSID;
const ReSIDDmpPlayer = @import("resid.zig").ReSIDDmpPlayer;

pub fn main() !void {
    const stdout = std.io.getStdOut().writer();

    const samplingRate: i32 = 44100;

    try stdout.print("[MAIN] zigSID audio demo unthreaded!\n", .{});

    // -- create sid and configure it
    var sid = try ReSID.init("MyZIGSID");
    defer sid.deinit();
    _ = sid.setChipModel("MOS8580"); // just demo usage, this is the default

    // -- create player and initialize it with a demo sound
    var player = try ReSIDDmpPlayer.init(sid.ptr);
    defer player.deinit();
    player.setDmp(sounddata.demo_sid, sounddata.demo_sid_len); // set buffer of demo sound

    // -- THAT's IT! All we have to do now is to call player.play()
    // For this SDL implementation we need SDL to callback our
    // player.sdlAudioCallback(), it is specified below.
    // The userdata is required to point to the player object

    // -- init sdl with a callback to our player

    // SDL2 Audio Initialization
    var spec = SDL.SDL_AudioSpec{
        .freq = samplingRate,
        .format = SDL.AUDIO_S16,
        .channels = 1,
        .samples = 4096,
        .callback = ReSIDDmpPlayer.getAudioCallback(),
        .userdata = @ptrCast(&player), // reference to player
    };

    if (SDL.SDL_Init(SDL.SDL_INIT_AUDIO) < 0) {
        try stdout.print("[MAIN] Failed to initialize SDL audio: {s}\n", .{SDL.SDL_GetError()});
        return;
    }
    defer SDL.SDL_Quit();

    const dev = SDL.SDL_OpenAudioDevice(null, 0, &spec, null, 0);
    if (dev == 0) {
        try stdout.print("[MAIN] Failed to open SDL audio device: {s}\n", .{SDL.SDL_GetError()});
        return;
    }
    defer SDL.SDL_CloseAudioDevice(dev);

    SDL.SDL_PauseAudioDevice(dev, 0); // Start playback
    try stdout.print("[MAIN] SDL audio started at {d} Hz.\n", .{samplingRate});

    // -- end of SDL initialization

    // all we have to do now is to call .play()

    player.play();

    // print the SID registers
    for (1..10) |_| {
        const regs = sid.getRegs(); // [25]u8 array

        try stdout.print("[MAIN] SID Registers: ", .{});
        for (regs) |value| {
            try stdout.print("{x:0>2} ", .{value});
        }
        try stdout.print("\n", .{});
        std.time.sleep(0.5 * std.time.ns_per_s);
    }

    try stdout.print("[MAIN] Press enter to exit\n", .{});
    _ = std.io.getStdIn().reader().readByte() catch null;

    player.stop();

    SDL.SDL_PauseAudioDevice(dev, 1); // Stop playback
    try stdout.print("[MAIN] SDL audio stopped.\n", .{});
}
```

### main_threaded.zig - audio buffer calculation in a dedicated thread

This example demonstrates a more advanced approach to playing a SID dump.  
The `sid` and `player` struct instances are initialized the same way as in the unthreaded version. Playback also starts by calling `player.play()`.  

Before starting playback, the player must be instructed **not** to update the audio buffer within the SDL audio thread. This is done by calling:  
```zig
player.updateExternal(true);
```

SDL2 continues handling audio playback in the background. However, the audio buffer will no longer be updated automatically. The responsibility to call `player.update()` now lies with the user.  

The `update()` function only performs computations when the audio buffer has been consumed by SDL, ensuring efficient CPU usage. To maintain continuous playback, `update()` must be called at intervals shorter than the playback duration of the audio buffer (**4096 samples**).

The dedicated thread runs this `update()` function in a loop and exits gracefully once playback is complete. It runs until the player has stopped playing. It will check the player state via:  
```zig
player.isPlaying();
```

#### Realtime audio visualization and modification

Running `update()` in a separate thread enables **real-time audio visualization** and **manipulation**.  
The active audio buffer can be accessed via:  
```zig
([*c]c_short) player.getPBData().buf_playing
```

The playback mechanism uses a **double-buffering strategy**:  
- While SDL plays `player.getPBData().buf_playing`,  
- `player.getPBData().buf_next` is prepared by `update()`. By modifying this buffer you can control the audio!    
Once the playback buffer is fully consumed, the buffers are **swapped internally** to maintain seamless playback.


```zig
const std = @import("std");
const sounddata = @cImport({
    @cInclude("demo_sound.h");
});
const SDL = @cImport({
    @cInclude("SDL.h");
});

const ReSID = @import("resid.zig").ReSID;
const ReSIDDmpPlayer = @import("resid.zig").ReSIDDmpPlayer;

fn playerThreadFunc(player: *ReSIDDmpPlayer) void {
    while (player.isPlaying()) {
        player.update();
        std.time.sleep(5 * std.time.ns_per_ms);
    }
}

pub fn main() !void {
    const stdout = std.io.getStdOut().writer();
    const samplingRate: i32 = 44100;

    try stdout.print("[MAIN] zigSID audio demo threaded!\n", .{});

    // -- create sid and configure it
    var sid = try ReSID.init("MyZIGSID");
    defer sid.deinit();
    _ = sid.setChipModel("MOS8580"); // just demo usage, this is the default

    // -- create player and initialize it with a demo sound
    var player = try ReSIDDmpPlayer.init(sid.ptr);
    defer player.deinit();
    player.setDmp(sounddata.demo_sid, sounddata.demo_sid_len); // set buffer of demo sound
    player.updateExternal(true); // make sure, SDL does not call the update-
    // function

    // -- THAT's IT! All we have to do now is to call player.play()
    // For this SDL implementation we need SDL to callback our
    // player.sdlAudioCallback(), it is specified below.
    // The userdata is required to point to the player object
    // The audio callback is not calling player.update(), so we will start
    // our update thread directly after player.play
    // (to make sure, player.isPlaying will return true)

    // -- init sdl with a callback to our player

    // SDL2 Audio Initialization
    var spec = SDL.SDL_AudioSpec{
        .freq = samplingRate,
        .format = SDL.AUDIO_S16,
        .channels = 1,
        .samples = 4096,
        .callback = ReSIDDmpPlayer.getAudioCallback(),
        .userdata = @ptrCast(&player), // reference to player
    };

    if (SDL.SDL_Init(SDL.SDL_INIT_AUDIO) < 0) {
        try stdout.print("[MAIN] Failed to initialize SDL audio: {s}\n", .{SDL.SDL_GetError()});
        return;
    }
    defer SDL.SDL_Quit();

    const dev = SDL.SDL_OpenAudioDevice(null, 0, &spec, null, 0);
    if (dev == 0) {
        try stdout.print("[MAIN] Failed to open SDL audio device: {s}\n", .{SDL.SDL_GetError()});
        return;
    }
    defer SDL.SDL_CloseAudioDevice(dev);

    SDL.SDL_PauseAudioDevice(dev, 0); // Start playback
    try stdout.print("[MAIN] SDL audio started at {d} Hz.\n", .{samplingRate});

    // -- end of SDL initialization

    // all we have to do now is to call .play()

    player.play(); // now player.isPlaying() will return true
    const playerThread = try std.Thread.spawn(.{}, playerThreadFunc, .{&player});
    defer playerThread.join(); // Wait for the thread to finish (if needed)

    // print the SID registers
    for (1..10) |_| {
        const regs = sid.getRegs(); // [25]u8 array

        try stdout.print("[MAIN] SID Registers: ", .{});
        for (regs) |value| {
            try stdout.print("{x:0>2} ", .{value});
        }
        try stdout.print("\n", .{});
        std.time.sleep(0.5 * std.time.ns_per_s);
    }

    try stdout.print("[MAIN] Press enter to exit\n", .{});
    _ = std.io.getStdIn().reader().readByte() catch null;

    player.stop();

    SDL.SDL_PauseAudioDevice(dev, 1); // Stop playback
    try stdout.print("[MAIN] SDL audio stopped.\n", .{});
}
